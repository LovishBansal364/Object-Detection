# 🛠️ Object Detection using OpenCV in Python

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements an **Object Detection** system using **OpenCV** in Python. It can detect multiple objects in images, videos, or in real-time using your webcam. Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labels, making it easy to visualize what the model identifies.

## ✨ Features

* Detect multiple objects in images and videos 🖼️🎥
* Real-time object detection with webcam 🎬
* Bounding boxes and labels for detected objects 📦✏️
* Easy to customize for different object detection tasks 🛠️

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x** 🐍
* **OpenCV** for computer vision 🖥️
* **NumPy** for numerical operations ➗

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. Input (image/video/webcam) is captured.
2. The pre-trained object detection model identifies objects.
3. Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labels.
4. The results are displayed in real-time or saved for later.

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* Add support for custom datasets 📚
* Improve detection speed with YOLOv8 or other advanced models ⚡
* Include object tracking for videos 🎯
